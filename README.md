# abstract

The {renv} package aims to *help* users create reproducible environments for R projects. In theory, this is great! In practice, restoring a package environment can be a frustrating process due to overlooked R configuration requirements. Join me to better understand the source of environment restoration issues and learn strategies for successful maintenance of {renv}-backed projects.
